### Hi there 👋

My name is Michał. I am fascinated by new technologies and how they change our everyday life. I work as a Head of Emerging Technologies at Objectivity and am responsible for introducing cutting-edge technologies in clients' organisations. 

Right now, my main point of interest is ⚛️quantum computing. I am focusing on defining areas where this technology can be used and deliver value. In most cases, those areas are related to optimisation and combinatorial challenges. 

This is where I share my open source projects and experiment by testing their limits.
